<h3>Hello World, it's Poojitha.</h3>

<p>Hi there! By the title, it's pretty obvious what my name is but I shall reintroduce myself, and maybe, tell you a little bit more about me. My name is Poojitha, a student pursuing Artificial Intelligence, who likes to log whatever she learns, be it academic or not.</p>

<p>You see, I've always been rather hyperfixated on things that catch my immediate interest. Whether it's diving deep into the world of music, getting lost in the pages of a captivating novel, or experimenting with new baking recipes, I tend to obsess over my current fascination. Lately, my primary obsession has been the fascinating field of Artificial Intelligence and all the incredible possibilities it holds.</p>

<p>However, I often find myself losing interest or motivation after the initial novelty wears off. That's where this blog comes in â€“ it's my way of documenting my learning journey, sharing insights, and (hopefully) keeping myself accountable and engaged in the topics that excite me most. By chronicling my experiences, reflections, and even struggles, I hope to not only reinforce my own understanding but also connect with others who share similar intellectual curiosities.</p>

<p>So join me as I explore the realms of AI, music, literature, culinary adventures, and who knows what else will pique my interest along the way. Let's embark on this learning adventure together and see where our boundless curiosity takes us!</p>
